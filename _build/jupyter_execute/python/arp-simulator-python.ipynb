    "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a vital component of local network communication. It helps devices find the hardware (MAC) address of a device based on its IP address. In this blog post, we'll dive into an ARP simulator project that provides a client-server model to simulate ARP processes. This tool is an excellent resource for learning about ARP and network programming.\n",

    "## **ARP Server Implementation in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script demonstrates a simple ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) server that listens for incoming connections and responds to ARP requests. The server maintains a predefined dictionary of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses. When a client sends an IP address to the server, it looks up the IP in the dictionary and returns the associated MAC address. If the IP address is not found in the dictionary, it responds with \"Not Found\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Key Components:\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "- **Network Dictionary:** A dictionary named `NETWORK` is defined at the beginning of the script. This dictionary contains IP addresses as keys and their corresponding MAC addresses as values.\n",
    "- **Server Setup:** The server is configured to listen on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and port `65432`. It uses the socket library to create a TCP socket and bind it to the specified IP address and port.\n",
    "- **Listening for Connections:** The server starts listening for incoming connections. When a connection is established, it accepts the connection and enters a loop to continuously receive and respond to ARP requests from the client.\n",
    "- **Handling ARP Requests:** When the server receives an IP address from the client, it checks the `NETWORK` dictionary for the corresponding MAC address. If found, it sends the MAC address back to the client. If not, it responds with `\"Not Found\"`.\n",
    "- **Continuous Operation:** The server runs indefinitely, waiting for incoming connections and responding to ARP requests.\n",
