# **Computer Networks**

Welcome to this guide on Computer Networks and some of the software/tools involved in learning and understanding computer networks. The goal of this guide is to help you familiarise yourself with the basics of computer networks and some of the tools to understand the networks better. This resource contains guides for CISCO Packet Tracer, Wireshark and Python.

This project started as part of my helping others task when I undertook Computer Networks (SIT202) at Deakin University. But I have decided to expand it to include more resources and tools that can help students and professionals in the field of computer networks. I hope that this guide will help you understand computer networks better and provide you with the resources you need to succeed in your studies. New resources will be added over time, so be sure to check back for updates.

## **Wireshark**

Wireshark is a network protocol analyser that captures and displays the data travelling back and forth on a network. It is a great tool for network troubleshooting and analysis. Wireshark can be used to capture and analyse network traffic in real-time or from a saved file. It can be used to troubleshoot network issues, detect network intrusions, and monitor network traffic. 

## **CISCO Packet Tracer**

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows you to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate network traffic. It is a great tool for learning about networking concepts and practising network configurations. Packet Tracer is used by students, instructors, and network professionals to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks.

## **Python**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for network programming. Python has a rich set of libraries and modules that make it easy to work with network protocols and data. Python can be used to automate network tasks, build network applications, and analyse network data. Python is a versatile language that is used in many different fields, including networking, web development, data science, and machine learning.
