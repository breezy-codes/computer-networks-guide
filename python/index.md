# Python Documentation

This section includes Python-based tools and simulations that complement networking concepts covered in this book. From simulating ARP tables to building basic servers and exploring routing algorithms, these resources are designed to help you understand how networks work, programmatically.

## Currently included

- An **ARP simulator** that helps you visualise how address resolution works
- A **simple Python server** to demonstrate client-server architecture
- A deep dive into **network routing algorithms**, including:
  - Bellman-Ford for distance vector routing
  - Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for link-state routing

More tutorials and tools will be added over time. If you have ideas or specific requests, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briannalaird) or leave a comment on YouTube.
